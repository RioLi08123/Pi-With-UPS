# Use case
I install [Bitfocus Companion on Pi](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion) so it is a show control system for broadcast equipment like ATEM and Propresenter and because it have a UPS so my show more stable.

But i found out i can install Companion on Pc so i just [install Homeassistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi/) on my Pi.

My Homeassistant run on my Proxmox before is was a VM and my Proxmox a not too stable so i just move my Homeassistant to my pi.
